The current goal of this branch is to improve part of the library which is related to pyHegel extra

Here are some of the idea I'd like to implement
    - Make a debug mode for pyHegel that enables to test the behavior of an experiment 
      without being pluged into any machines. I think I'm going to make a whole subbranch 
	for this as it might takes a long time to get rigth.
    - Add somme algorithms in an abstraction around the guzik.
	As an example, JO's autocorrelation code probaly wont make sens if used with another card.
	Therfore it could appear as an attribute of guzik wrapper. This should also be a branch.
